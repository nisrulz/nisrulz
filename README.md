<h2>Hi there 👋, I am Nishant</h2>

- 👨🏻‍💻  &nbsp;I’m primarily an Android Engineer. 
- 👨🏻‍🔬  &nbsp;I like experimenting with tech. This has led me into many interesting domains such as writing firmware code for [custom wearable hardware](https://www.kickstarter.com/projects/352439100/soundbrenner-core-the-4-in-1-smart-music-tool) and building mobile SDKs for [enabling DSP on Android](https://www.businesstoday.in/magazine/features/silverpushs-technology-lets-advertisers-reach-the-consumer-on-multiple-devices/story/206815.html). 
- 🤗  &nbsp;I love contributing to the open-source ecosystem and the community by [giving talks](https://crushingcode.nisrulz.com/talks/), [writing blog posts](https://crushingcode.nisrulz.com/archive/), [co-authoring/reviewing books](https://crushingcode.nisrulz.com/showcase/books/), [building Android libraries](https://github.com/nisrulz/nisrulz.github.io#open-source-contributions), etc. whenever I can.
- 🌱  &nbsp;I’m currently (trying to) learn Rust lang
- 💬  &nbsp;I dabble in Android, Kotlin, Java, Rust, UI/UX and spend most of my time automating my life via literally living inside the terminal 🤷🏻‍♂️
- 📝  &nbsp;I often blog about random tips/tricks and (mostly) Android [at] [Crushing C.O.D.E](https://crushingcode.nisrulz.com/)
- ⚡️  &nbsp;Fun fact about me: I love playing 🕹&nbsp;retro games and survive on ☕️ instead of energy drinks 🙇🏻‍♂️ &nbsp;Possibly this is why I also talk a lot 🤔
- 📫  &nbsp;Reach me [at] [nisrulz.com](https://www.nisrulz.com)
- ☕️ &nbsp;You can support me in maintaining my open source work by [buying me a coffee](https://www.buymeacoffee.com/nisrulz) or [sponsoring me on GitHub](https://github.com/sponsors/nisrulz)&nbsp;🤗
